Question #1
A. Primary Entities and Attributes
FILM

FilmID (PK)

Title

Budget

ReleaseDate

DirectorName

ACTOR

ActorID (PK)

Name

Phone

PRODUCTION_COMPANY

CompanyID (PK)

Name

B. Main Relationships and Cardinalities

Casting

Relationship between FILM and ACTOR

Cardinality: M:N

A film casts many actors, and an actor can appear in many films.

Production (Directed By)

Relationship between FILM and Director

Cardinality: 1:1

Each film has exactly one director (stored as an attribute).

Funding

Relationship between FILM and PRODUCTION_COMPANY

Cardinality: M:N

A film can be funded by multiple companies, and a company can fund many films.

C. Associative Entity for Rule 3 (M:N Relationship)
CASTING (Associative / Linking Entity)

Attributes:

FilmID (PK, FK → FILM)

ActorID (PK, FK → ACTOR)

CharacterName

Primary Key:

Composite Key: (FilmID, ActorID)

Reason:
The M:N relationship between Films and Actors cannot be implemented directly in a relational database. The associative entity resolves this and stores relationship-specific data (CharacterName).

D. Why DirectorName Should NOT Be a Separate Entity

The director has no independent attributes other than name.

The director does not participate in any other relationships.

Each film has exactly one director, and directors are not reused or queried independently.

Creating a separate entity would add unnecessary complexity without adding normalization benefits.

FLIGHT — has — FLIGHT_AVAILABILITY

1 : M

CITY — has — BOOKING_OFFICE

1 : 1

CUSTOMER — makes — BOOKING

1 : M

CUSTOMER — has — ADDRESS

M : 1 (addresses can be shared)

CUSTOMER — has — PHONE / FAX

M : N (numbers can be shared)

BOOKING — uses — EXCHANGE_RATE

M : 1 (rate depends on booking date)

Design Justifications (Important Points)

Email is unique, so it uniquely identifies customers.

Addresses, phones, and faxes are shared, so they must be separate entities.

Flight availability depends on date + time, hence composite key.

Exchange rates change daily, so date must be part of the key.

Airport taxes stored in local currency, linked to city and currency.

Booking stores price snapshot, so later exchange-rate changes don’t affect historical data.
